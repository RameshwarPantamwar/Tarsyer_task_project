1) Annotation through Mouse-Click

- Use `Task_1.jpg`, to write a code that will show the image to the user.
- Then the user will use the mouse to point out which rectangular area needs to be cropped.
- Save the cropped image as `Task_1_cropped.jpg`.
- Also save an image (`Task_1_insights.jpg`) - in this draw that rectangular box and also mention its top left and bottom right point.

3) Thresholding

- Perform simple and adaptive thresholding on `Task_3.jpg`. Save output images as `Task_3_simple.jpg` and `Task_3_adaptive.jpg`
